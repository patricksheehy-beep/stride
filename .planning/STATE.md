# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** Every generated route should feel like a local runner recommended it -- hitting the best trails, paths, and scenic spots in any location worldwide.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — architecture-foundation-and-data-layer

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (architecture-foundation-and-data-layer) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 16 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Strava heatmap excluded as data source per API terms -- "local knowledge" built from OSM signals instead
- [Roadmap]: Green space scoring grouped with NL input in Phase 3 (enriches the "vibe matching" capability)
- [Roadmap]: Web Worker and PWA deferred to Phase 4 (need scoring pipeline to exist before optimizing it)
- [Phase 01]: Used --legacy-peer-deps for vite-plugin-pwa 1.2.0 with Vite 8 (peer declares max Vite 7 but works fine)
- [Phase 01]: Leaflet imported from npm (bundled by Vite) rather than CDN for offline PWA support

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Claude API key security: client-side PWA cannot safely store Claude API key. Thin serverless proxy (Cloudflare Worker) needed before Phase 3 NL integration. Design during Phase 2 planning.
- ORS rate limit ceiling: 2,000 req/day limits to ~400 route generations/day. Acceptable for prototype but must be addressed before any public launch.
